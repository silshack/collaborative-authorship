abstract={The literature suggests generic workshops on the scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) rarely have a lasting impact on teaching. Seeking an alternative approach, academic developers designed a four-stage Collaborative Scholarship Model where they provided individualised SoTL mentoring to academics implementing a teaching innovation. Project outcomes included sustained change to teaching, openness to new ideas, scholarly contributions and peer recognition (through awards, publications or invited presentations). This model had a sustained impact on participants' teaching and increased research productivity. Although few individuals can be mentored at one time in this labour-intensive model, long-term benefits may still outweigh limitations in scalability. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Purpose: In addition to quantitative analysis, the purpose of this paper is to measure the quality of articles published in foreign LIS journals by Pakistani authors based on their Impact Factor (IF) scores reported in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) of 2010; also to discuss the significance and implications of this study for the current and potential authors in Pakistan and other developing countries. Design/methodology/approach: The data for this study were collected from two sets of sources: first, online sources of Google Scholar, LISA, LISTA, an online 50-year cumulative index of Pakistani LIS literature, and web pages of several authors; and second, printed indexes and bibliographies. The data collected were manually entered into MS Excel for tabulation and created nine tables, which formed the basis of discussion in the paper. Findings: The contribution of Pakistani authors to foreign LIS journals is reasonable in number and below average in quality, according to the JCR IF scores. The authorship patterns show that there is a shift from single-authorship to collaborative authorship. The contribution of academics is several times higher than that of library practitioners. Likewise the non-resident Pakistani authors' share in the global LIS literature is much larger as compared to their counterparts living in Pakistan. Originality/value: This is the first study that evaluates the quality of Pakistani LIS literature using the more popular journal ranking method, JCR IF. The results of this study are expected to have a positive impact on Pakistani authors as they start preparing articles according to the quality requirements of JCR-ranked journals in the future. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Recent developments in communicative planning theory and participatory research methods emphasize collaboration between researcher and research subject in the process of knowledge production. We ask how the ideal of collaboration that is integral to the process of data collection extends to the authorial phase of planning narratives and we identify ethical, pragmatic, and substantive justifications for collaborative authorship. The multidisciplinary literature on the city reveals a variety of approaches to authorship including empathetic evocation, selective deployment, dialogic collaboration, and uninterpreted transcription. More successful collaboration might require the avoidance of abstraction, an emphasis on contextualization and intersubjectivity, and a reimagining of social science from inquiry to conversation. © The Author(s) 2012.},

abstract={This paper examines the editorial discussion of Wikipedia's policy of "Neutral Point of View" during the collaborative authorship of the entry for Che Guevara. Such data provide a rare source of unprompted lay metalanguage on the relationship between the lexicogrammatical form of a text and its evaluative orientation and make possible an inductive approach to exploring this longstanding issue in critical linguistics inquiry. The paper illustrates this inductive approach in selecting a stretch of text identified by the editors themselves as problematic and relating their metalinguistic commentaries to the lexicogrammatical features of both the original text and the variations proposed. However, recognizing that naturally occurring metalanguage is itself situated within its own social practice, the paper considers ways in which the editors' readings are a function of their role as Wikipedia "prosumers" and goes on to discuss the need to theorize specific reader types within critical linguistic approaches to discourse analysis.},

abstract={In conjunction with Iowa City's 2008 designation as a UNESCO City of Literature, an interdisciplinary team of University of Iowa faculty, graduate and undergraduate student researchers formed UCOL - the University of Iowa UNESCO City of Literature Mobile Application Development Team. The project brings together community partners, faculty, students and staff at the university to develop, record and produce multimedia research about local writers for 'City of Lit', a mobile app now available for mobile devices. During the past year, the project was incorporated into three sections of a general education literature course, giving undergraduate students experience conducting research and creating multimedia content on local authors. Students in this class worked collectively to create multimedia hypertext documents that feature traditional text, photos, graphics, and audio and video content for inclusion in the mobile app. The project encouraged interdisciplinary collaborative undergraduate research. Student reflections and presentations, along with a formal survey designed by the research team, suggest that the project provided valuable learning outcomes through its integration of literary research and analysis, New Media and technology, and local community engagement within team-based learning. The authors' research indicates that the creation of peer-assisted scholarship positively facilitated the peer learning process, particularly with groups of three students.},

abstract={Academic collaboration is vital to advancing rigorous scholarship in engineering education. Despite its significance recognition among scholars and the government, prior studies have revealed that engineering education researchers still work in isolation in their academic activities. However, the overall collaboration patterns and what factors contribute to the breadth of collaboration remain largely unknown. In this paper, we reveal the collaboration patterns among engineering education researchers based on bibliographic data analysis. We select 7,732 NSF awards related to engineering education from EHR-DGE, EHR-DRL, EHR-DUE, and ENG-EEC. We then develop a keyphrase extraction algorithm to determine the main research topics of an award and utilize a name disambiguation system to precisely identify co-authorship. Our findings show that EER awardees collaborate more than researchers in the general disciplines of engineering and education. Also, average number of awardees per award is highly correlated with the number of awards. We further identify three categories of research topics that show different patterns in terms of level of collaborative engagement. We believe that our research results will provide comprehensive and insightful understanding of collaboration patterns within the engineering education research community.

Between July 15 th, 2011 and July 17 th, 71 authors, 8 invited and the rest voluntary members of the community, collaborated over Twitter, tweeting a "novel" 140 characters at a time. Dubbed "Novel Iowa City," the project was displayed to the public during the Iowa City Book Festival attended by thousands. This paper presents a qualitative analysis of the product of this process, reflecting on the challenges community-based authorship imposes on the writing of fiction and suggests best practices for future collaborative fiction projects. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Researchers in digital humanities have for many years been producing online editions of texts based on TEI XML, a widely-adopted standard for marking up textual resources with semantic content. However, this has led to a certain isolation of information, the so-called digital silo, and such modes of digital publication have not always made best use of the possibilities of digital technologies. The model is also challenged by the need to model texts that are by their very nature interconnected. The paper describes a collaborative environment of tools and techniques for working with texts that allows scholars to work with such highly-interconnected material. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={One of the major problems in developing countries is minority access to higher education. Traditional scholarships usually focus on paying tuition fees for bringing brilliant students to developed countries (from where they seldom return). But local grants seldom target the more needy students. We propose a system of student loans to pay tuition fees in exchange for technical work. This appears to be a satisfactory and sustainable solution. We also provide UBURYO (a Kirundi word meaning opportunity). UBURYO is the free open source software, that we have developed, to manage this loan system in a simple, trustworthy, fair and efficient way. © 2012 IEEE.},

The value of the traditional model of the solitary humanities scholar or the collaborative science paradigm should not be discounted. However, increasing the use of collaborative and interdisciplinary research models in the humanities would promote new forms of scholarship and also help to create a better, more integral and inclusive world. © 2012 The Author(s).},

abstract={This study determines how library and information science (LIS) research in Taiwan has changed between 2001 and 2010. The major research questions address the research status of LIS in Taiwan, how the Taiwanese government supports the field, and the collaborative authorship of LIS journal articles in Taiwan. Bibliometric and content analysis methods were conducted to analyze 2,494 journal articles, 983 theses, and 191 research projects between 2001 and 2010. The results show LIS and Technology to be the most popular topics in journal articles. The most well-received thesis topics are LIS and Technology and User Services, accounting for more than 50 % of graduate theses. The same is true for research projects, with the subjects of LIS and Technology, LIS Theory and Foundation, and User Services having a ratio of more than 70 %. In government-sponsored research projects, the average amount of funding obtained had no significant differences or tendencies for various subjects over time. In authorship of journal articles, individual researchers conducted 66.11 % of articles in key LIS scholarly journals in Taiwan between 2001 and 2010. © 2012 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

abstract={Wiki-like or crowdsourcing models of collaboration can provide a number of benefits to academic work. These techniques may engage expertise from different disciplines, and potentially increase productivity. This paper presents a model of massively distributed collaborative authorship of academic papers. This model, developed by a collective of thirty authors, identifies key tools and techniques that would be necessary or useful to the writing process. The process of collaboratively writing this paper was used to discover, negotiate, and document issues in massively authored scholarship. Our work provides the first extensive discussion of the experiential aspects of large-scale collaborative research. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={This paper presents a condensed history of Library and Information Science (LIS) over the course of more than a century using a variety of bibliometric measures. It examines in detail the variable rate of knowledge production in the field, shifts in subject coverage, the dominance of particular publication genres at different times, prevailing modes of production, interactions with other disciplines, and, more generally, observes how the field has evolved. It shows that, despite a striking growth in the number of journals, papers, and contributing authors, a decrease was observed in the field's market-share of all social science and humanities research. Collaborative authorship is now the norm, a pattern seen across the social sciences. The idea of boundary crossing was also examined: in 2010, nearly 60% of authors who published in LIS also published in another discipline. This high degree of permeability in LIS was also demonstrated through reference and citation practices: LIS scholars now cite and receive citations from other fields more than from LIS itself. Two major structural shifts are revealed in the data: in 1960, LIS changed from a professional field focused on librarianship to an academic field focused on information and use; and in 1990, LIS began to receive a growing number of citations from outside the field, notably from Computer Science and Management, and saw a dramatic increase in the number of authors contributing to the literature of the field. © 2012 ASIS&T.},

abstract={This article presents the development and implementation of a wiki-based application for the delivery of educational content in dentistry. The Dental Procedure Education System (DPES) is a new web application that uses SharePoint to combine online collaborative authoring characteristic of wiki spaces with instructional video documentaries. Harnessing the wiki's versatility, DPES offers faculty members an avenue to develop an authoritative source of information for both students, through DPES Pro, and the public at large, through DPES Public. Principles of cognitive theory of multimedia learning, constructivist theory, and collaborative writing were employed in the development of DPES. An authoring protocol, with a clearly defined sequence of steps, was established in order to keep the production of the DPES procedures consistent and predictable. Initial, anecdotal user reports indicate that DPES is well received among dental students and faculty members. Expected outcomes and benefits of DPES use are discussed, and directions for research are proposed.},

abstract={Background: Developing and ensuring successful collaborative research in medical education is no small task, but the rewards to researchers can be great. Collaborative research in medical education offers significant opportunities for investigators who wish to pool limited resources and expand professional networks. Despite this, collaboration often occurs without advance planning for the logistical aspects of collaborative work. Aims and Methods: These 12 tips, derived from developing and presenting a session on strategies for effective collaboration conducted at a national meeting, will assist readers who are planning to collaborate or are already engaged in collaborative scholarship. The tips are organized into items to consider in three phases of collaboration: planning, implementation, and dissemination of outcomes. Results and Conclusions: From selecting a topic to recognizing when the collaboration should end, the tips underscore the importance of good communication, and clear expectations for participants. © 2011 Informa UK Ltd.

abstract={Owing to the inherent difficulty in obtaining experimental data from wikis, past quantitative wiki research has largely focused on Wikipedia, limiting the ability to generalize such research. To facilitate the analysis of wikis other than Wikipedia, we developed WikiCrawler, a tool that automatically gathers research data from public wikis without supervision. We then built a corpus of 151 wikis, which we have made publicly available. Our analysis indicated that these wikis display signs of collaborative authorship, validating them as objects of study. We then performed an initial analysis of the corpus and discovered some similarities with Wikipedia, such as users contributing at unequal rates. We also analyzed distributions of edits across pages and users, resulting in data which can motivate or verify mathematical models of behavior on wikis. By providing data collection tools and a corpus of already-collected data, we have completed an important first step for investigations that analyze user behavior, establish measurement baselines for wiki evaluation, and generalize Wikipedia research by testing hypotheses across many wikis. © 2011 ASIS&T.},

An investigation of geo-science scholarship and technical pilot studies highlighted the importance of situational specific and distributed information usage. To advance our understanding of novel resource approaches (i.e. from tabletops to tablets) and collaborative learning, two in-depth field trials evaluated 21 students' information journeys (i.e. initiating information needs, facilitating information and collaborative interpretation). Analysis identified how a designing for a varied device ecology supported information filtering and empathy between locations provoking deeper reflection and abstract understanding in the field, while live collaborative remote interaction provided an engaging yet distinct learning experience for those in the laboratory. © 2011 Authors.},

abstract={In his article Collaborative Authorship and Indigenous Literatures Albert Braz discusses the duality of the writer. At least since the advent of poststructuralism, the distinction between writer and author - the first being the historical person behind the text and the second a figure in the text - has been a paradigm of contemporary critical analysis. Braz argues that this new emphasis is not germane when it comes to Indigenous literatures, a field in which one often cannot determine who are the material producers of texts and/or their writers. Braz postulates that one of the defining characteristics of Indigenous literatures is their high incidence of writer indeterminacy. From the Popol Vuh through Cogewea to I, Rigoberta Menchu ́, canonical Indigenous texts are the result of collaboration, usually (but not always) involving both Indigenous and non-Indigenous individuals. Since by definition Indigenous texts are supposed to be the work of Indigenous people, writer indeterminacy forces us to reconsider what really constitutes Indigenous literature.},

abstract={One of the most obvious problems in collaborative authorship is omitting authors from a paper. The classic form of omission occurs when two collaborators are in conflict and one leaves the other's name off a paper out of spite. Scientific research is increasingly international in scope and practice. Worldwide, the percentage of science and engineering research articles with authors from more than one country increased from 8 percent in 1988 to 22 percent in 2007, according to the 2010 Science and Engineering Indicators compiled by the US National Science Foundation. Surprise authorship is when a researcher finds out after publication that his or her name appears on a paper. Honorary authorship is often equated with gift authorship, but the motivations are different. Honorary authorship goes to individuals with higher status, as a way of honoring them personally or in their roles as superiors.},

abstract={Based on reflections from over a decade of research, scholarship, and programmatic applications, this article provides evidence of impact from the work of Professor Andy Hargreaves with a specific focus on his concept of contrived collegiality. Explorations into matters of emotion provided an entry point through which the author has addressed the potential for overcoming patterns of contrived collegiality. Early research resulted in a theoretical framework of emotional epistemologies which has been foundational to the design and delivery of professional development and master's degree programs as well as further research into the evidence of impact from this approach to leadership development. The engagement with emotional meaning making, when treated as a way of building trust and developing collaborative learning communities, has proven a good match for the otherwise relatively contrived collegiality that Professor Hargreaves identified. Professor Hargreaves' contributions to the author's journey are a feature of the piece. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={In this article, authors report one College of Nursing's efforts to address the challenges of multiple academic role expectations by establishing faculty interest groups to promote collaborative scholarship. The background of the project is described in terms of past and recent academic, financial, and environmental influences. Collaborative scholarship is defined. Literature related to faculty productivity, variations in collaborative scholarship within and across disciplines, and incentives to motivate and reward faculty productivity are discussed. An evaluation of one faculty interest group's process is reported. Amey and Brown's Interdisciplinary Collaboration Model dimensions were used to analyze achievements and challenges. Organizational restructuring and disbandment of these groups provided a second opportunity to reflect on lessons learned. One perspective about the process and educational and professional implications of collaborative scholarship that would be of interest to faculty is provided. Lessons learned may inform other faculty facing the same task. Copyright © 2010 Berkeley Electronic Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The issue of accelerating faculty scholarship is a key item especially for new/untenured faculty. New faculty future career success depends on developing scholarship productivity quickly. Previous research has shown how mentoring new faculty at the early stages of their career has had significant impact on new faculty success. Mentorship is especially important at institutions that have an increasing demand for faculty scholarship. The new untenured faculty must also learn and balance teaching and service responsibilities. In addition to essential mentoring of untenured faculty by senior faculty, untenured faculty can also benefit from peer mentoring by other untenured faculty. This paper reviews practical advice for creating a collaborative, untenured faculty peer scholarship team, in our case called Untenured Faculty Accelerated Scholarship Team (UFAST). In this paper, the authors will discuss what drove the need to form UFAST and the practical advice which has been developed by the UFAST team. This paper will also provide an account of individual experiences in developing scholarship agendas as new faculty. The authors conclude with the advice that operating as a collegial and collaborative scholarship team, especially one whose members' existence depends on the team's success, allows the untenured faculty members to quickly share, support, and achieve individual scholarship success. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2010.},

abstract={An ethics of enhancement should not rest on blanket judgments; it should ask us to distinguish between the kinds of activities we want to enhance. Both students and academics have turned to cognition-enhancing drugs in signifcant numbers-but is their enhancement a form of cheating? The answer should hinge on whether the activity subject to enhancement is zero-sum or non-zero-sum, and whether one is more concerned with excellence in process or excellence in outcome. Cognitive enhancement should be especially tolerated when the activities at stake are non-zero-sum and when the importance of process is outweighed by the importance of outcome. The use of cognition-enhancing drugs does not unnaturally cheapen accomplishments achieved under their infuence; instead, cognitive enhancement is in line with well-established conceptions of collaborative authorship, which shift the locus of praise and blame from individual creators to the ultimate products of their efforts. © 2010 by The Johns Hopkins University Press.},

abstract={As two faculty members in a Canadian post-secondary teacher education context, the authors inquired into their collaborative writing process initiated through an informal faculty mentoring relationship. Situating their writing in the discourses of personal practical knowledge, social constructionism, narrative inquiry, and autobiography grounds their understanding of relational writing as side-by-side collaborators who engage in a bodily co-present writing process, negotiating the many nuances of text construction. By using a metaphor of carefully pairing exquisite wine with fine food, they convey the mutual co-construction of their lived experiences that evolve through relational writing. Highlighting related literature in the areas of mentoring, writing terminology, traits of collaborators, writing process, and benefits of collaboration assists them in comparing and contrasting the literature with features unique to their own collaboration. They conclude by noting critical issues and implications regarding collaborative writing that offer insight into the importance of honoring collaborative scholarship within academic contexts. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Due to the inherent difficulty in obtaining experimental data from wikis, past quantitative wiki research has largely been focused on Wikipedia, limiting the degree that it can be generalized. We developed WikiCrawler, a tool that automatically downloads and analyzes wikis, and studied 151 popular wikis running Mediawiki (none of them Wikipedias). We found that our studied wikis displayed signs of collaborative authorship, validating them as objects of study. We also discovered that, as in Wikipedia, the relative contribution levels of users in the studied wikis were highly unequal, with a small number of users contributing a disproportionate amount of work. In addition, power-law distributions were successfully fitted to the contribution levels of most of the studied wikis, and the parameters of the fitted distributions largely predicted the high inequality that was found. Along with demonstrating our methodology of analyzing wikis from diverse sources, the discovered similarities between wikis suggest that most wikis accumulate edits through a similar underlying mechanism, which could motivate a model of user activity that is applicable to wikis in general.

abstract={In a few years, Wikipedia has become one of the information systems with more public of the Internet. Based on a relatively simple architecture it has proven to be capable of supporting the largest and more diverse community of collaborative authorship worldwide. Using a quantitative methodology, (analyzing public Wikipedia databases), we describe the main characteristics of the 10 largest language editions, and the authors that work in them. The methodology is generic enough to be used on the rest of the editions, providing a convenient framework to develop a complete quantitative analysis of the Wikipedia. Among other parameters, we study the evolution of the number of contributions and articles, their size, and the differences in contributions by different authors, inferring some relationships between contribution patterns and content. These relationships reflect (and in part, explain) the evolution of the different language editions so far, as well as their future trends. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The popularity of online sharing sites featuring user-generated content (UGC) has brought a dramatic increase in production and reproduction of UGCs. Time magazine's selection of "You" as its person of the year 2006 apparently shows the rapid rise of users as content producers. We are now entering an era of prosumers where the role of producers and consumers is beginning to merge as predicted by Alvin Toffler. In the world of prosumers, a single content evolves into many derivative contents as seen in the phenomenon of Star Wars Kid, where many adapted versions of the original content were created, adding music, texts, etc. This kind of collaborative authorship model is difficult to represent using conventional authorship models. Collaborative authorship is a dynamic authorship where additional authorship information is appended to the existing authorship information. This paper defines extended concepts of authorship, lists their requirements and proposes a scheme to support them. © IEEE.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to show, using the example of socialist Yugoslavia, how and why authors' rights laws were applied in a socialist regime relying on the same rhetoric of ownership and individualism that marked their use in the capitalist West. In this way, Yugoslav laws have served us as an excuse to examine the connection between rights guaranteed by the legal apparatus and a type of control over creative processes that these rights make possible. Since it is a fact that both single-party socialism and pluralist capitalism have employed the same concept of authors' rights and authorship, it is our claim that the two systems have been and are equally interested in limiting creative freedom by means of property derived from authors' rights. To the extent to which Yugoslav legislative, political, cultural, and ideological practice borrowed from the Soviet variety of socialism, we will consider examples from that tradition as well, treating it as the strictest incarnation of Marxism in Europe. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Woodmansee, The Author, Art, and the Market: Rereading the History of Aesthetics (New York: Columbia University Press, 1994), 36Hesse, C., (1991) Publishing and Cultural Politics in Revolutionary Paris, 1789-1810, pp. 83-124. , Berkeley, Los Angeles, Oxford: University of California Press; According to Jean Paul Sartre, the early bourgeoisie was in dire need of a voice, while the literary authors sought the freedom of expression. The result was a peculiar symbiosis. As Sartre states, in most pragmatic terms, 'it was enough for [the author] to defend his profession in order to serve as a guide to the aspirations of the rising class'. In time, though, through the changes of the copyright/authors' rights laws, this original concept of authorship further evolved to suit better the interests of the market, or the consumer class.

IV, 375), as well as Selected Works, I, 363R.C. Tucker, ed., The Marx-Engels Reader (New York: W.W. Norton, 1972), from The German Ideology, p. 137. Granted, Marx is here analyzing the division between the productive and the intellectual part of the bourgeois class of his time, but there is no indication that a similar division had not been the result of the working class' transformation into a ruling class, particularly because socialism chose to maintain the dichotomy of material and intellectual labor. Ironically, and as a result of the unchanging idea of authorship, the generation of Yugoslav writers who were active in 1980s worked to perfect the illusion of the class to which they belonged, but in practice that meant they made the working class believe it was a socialist hybrid of the middle class'The Marx correspondence abounds in numerous allusions to the workers' intellectual limitations, stupidity, and narrow-mindedness. Sometimes they are dismissed in such derogatory terms as asses, Knoten, Straubinger' which were erased from the 1913 Stuttgart edition of Der Briefwechsel zwishen Friedrich Engels und Karl Marx by editors August Bebei and Eduard. Bernstein (Avineri, supra n. 5, 269-275)'What is this principle of party literature? It is not simply that, for the socialist proletariat, literature cannot be a means of enriching individuals or groups: it cannot, in fact, be an individual undertaking, independent of the common cause of the proletariat. Down with non-partisan writers! Down with literary supermen! Literature must become part of the common cause of the proletariat, a cog and a screw of one single great Social-Democratic mechanism set in motion by the entire politically-conscious vanguard of the entire working class. Literature must become a component of organised, planned and integrated Social-Democratic Party work.' V.I. Lenin, Lenin Collected Works (Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1965), 45-46'The Leninist principle of partisanship in literature is the highest form, of dedication to the people, the fullest expression of the militant strength of the progressive-minded writers' convictions who consciously and openly devote their talent to the people and the cause of socialism'.

The most obvious example is the article which Lenin wrote in 1905 with the object of bringing order into the Party press and Party publications in the new conditions of legality. Under Stalin this article gradually became the Bible of partiinost in the whole field of culture and especially of literature, and although Krupskaya, Lenin's wife and closest collaborator, had drawn attention, to the fact that this article has absolutely no reference to literature, even today there is no lack of people who would like to let the Bible remain a Bible, G.

Ginsburg outlines the genesis of two laws which, though advocating superficially opposing approaches (French as author-oriented, and the US as public interest-oriented), both stem from the lawmakers' desire to limit the monopoly of the authors. J.C. Ginsburg, 'A Tale of Two Copyrights: Literary Property in Revolutionary France and America', Tulane Law Review 64/5 (1990), 991-1031V. Spaić, Teorija autorskog prava i autorsko pravo u SFRJ [Authors' Rights Theory and Authors' Rights in the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia, Zagreb, Beograd, Čakovec: Pravni fakultet Zagreb, Centar za stručno usavršavanje i suradnju s udruženim radom, RO Jugoslavenska autorska agencija Beograd, 1983, 21-22. It is important to emphasize here that Spaić's Teorija autorskog prava i autorsko pravo u SFRJ is the single most comprehensive treatment of authors' rights laws from the period of socialist Yugoslavia. Never translated to English, the main drive of this work is to fit the internationally accepted concept of property-based authors' rights into the system of socialist legislature, its theory, its practice, and its history. Though Spaić notes the main paradoxes of such an endeavor, as a law expert he is primarily trying to create rhetorical scaffolding that would support the existing legal conditions, i.e'Zakon o zaštiti autorskog prava [The Protection of the Authors' Rights Law]', Službeni list Federativne narodne republike Jugoslavije. Number 45. Year II. (1946), 519-521. One of the peculiarities of the law was that in Article 9, concerning the rights of the heirs to the author, it identifies authors as exclusively male and heterosexual by referring to their 'wives' rather than 'spouses'Armstrong, H.F., (1951) Tito and Goliath, , New York: Macmillan, xi; Spaić, supra n. 18, 22Armstrong, H.F., , p. 23Zakon o autorskom pravu [Authors' Rights Law] (1957) Službeni list Federative narodne republike Jugoslavije, 13, p. 681. , Number 36. Year; Spaić, supra n. 18, 24As an example, the USSR publishers at the time, unlike their Yugoslav counterparts, still had not conformed to the practice of paying for the translation rights of foreign works. J.N. Hazard, Communists and Their Law (Chicago London: The University of Chicago Press, 1969), 260Spaić, supra n. 18, at 6, from Materijal za izradu Predloga zakona o autorskom pravu, Primedbe Jugoslovenske radio-televizije [Materials for Drafting of the Proposal of the Authors' Rights Law, the Objections of the Yugoslav Radio and Television] (dr. I, Putišek), p. 14 and on. Interestingly enough, the issue seems to have been raised by the representatives of the Yugoslav Radio Television, who would have been less worried about the ideological differences between the socialist and capitalist view of authors' rights, were it not for the fact that their institution was fast becoming the single biggest exploiter of the cultural content. (All direct quotes from material originally available only in Croatian, Serbian and Slovenian were translated to English by the authors.)In Communists and Their Law, supra n. 26, John N. Hazard claims that, when it comes to socialist law, the term intellectual property is somewhat of a 'misnomer, inherited from a bourgeois world' (p. 243)'Although an author's right is essentially the right to deferred earnings, it has... certain attributes which create a similarity to property, and these are controlled as property is' (ibid., at 261)Anton Trstenjak, member of the Slovenian Academy of Arts and Sciences, defined authors' moral rights as 'a reflection of one's personality, or better yet [as] the personality itself and the author's work as 'the other side of his personality ... a visible side of human creativity' ('Psihološka podlaga moralnih avtorskih pravic [Psychological. Basis of the Moral Authors' Rights]' from Akademija in varstvo moralnih avtorskih pravic. Akademija in varstvo moralnih avtorskih pravic [The Academy and the Protection of Authors' Moral Rights]. A. Finžgar, J. Menart and D. Moravec, eds (Ljubljana: Slovenska akademija znanosti in umetnosti, 1988), 13-17)For Spaić, (supra n. 18, at 10) this materialization yields 'intellectual products [that] are the emanation of the author's person; they separate from the author's person as immaterial values and by it become an object of the economic right'Bogomir Sajovic, from the transcripts of the discussion, Akademija in varstvo moralnih avtorskih pravic, supra n. 29, at 62-63This was much disputed by, among others, the Soviet legal experts, as indicated by Serge L. Levitsky in Introduction to Soviet Copyright Law Leyden: A.W. Sythoff, 1964, 79Spaić, supra n. 18, at 5'_the capitalist monopoly, in whose hands the basic means of production are concentrated, dictates to the intellectual creators who depend on it, its conditions in terms of the honorarium, as well as in terms of the type and the quality of creation' (ibid., at 7)Alenka Puhar, in discussion, Akademija in varstvo moralnih avtorskih pravic, supra n. 29, 71The main source of ambiguity is the fact that, in practice, socialist self-management still resembles the conditions of state ownership due to the highly centralized one-party political systemSpaić, supra n.18, at 8. Here Spaić echoes Edvard KardeIj, one of the chief ideologues of the socialist Yugoslavia whose project of incorporated labor, arguably, contributed to the ruination of the Yugoslav economy. Potentially profitable enterprises were joined with businesses that mostly generated losses and affixed with large administrative apparatuses, while, at the same time, a worker's wage came to reflect not an individual's productivity, but the artificially set state norms, the purpose of which was to create an illusion of prosperityFor example, Yugoslav authors' rights laws deviated even further from the basic ideas of socialism, by allowing suits for not only the material, but also the immaterial damages in cases of infringement (Hazard, supra n. 26, at 264)Spaić, supra n. 18, at 9The Marx-Engels Reader, supra n. 7, at 58, from Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844, p. 59. , at'Religion, family, state, law, morality, science, art etc. are only particular modes of production and fall under its general law. The positive transcendence of private property as the appropriation of life is, therefore, the positive transcendence of all estrangement - that is to say, the return of the man from religion, family, state etc. [science and art including] to his human i.e., social mode of existence' (ibid., at 71), p. 58. , atOr as Marx would say, '... when I am active scientifically ... I am social, because I am active as a man. Not only is the material of my activity given to me as a social product (as is the language in which the thinker is active): my own existence is social activity, and therefore that which I make of myself, I make of myself for society and with the consciousness of myself as a social being' (ibid., at 72)The best-known example in the Soviet tradition is certainly Aleksei Grigorievich Stakhanov, a coal miner who gained renown in 1935 by digging 2,700 tons of coal in a single shift. His feat was matched by a Yugoslav miner, Alija Sirotanović, whose image was featured on the 20,000 dinar banknote. In this, both Stakhanov and Sirotanović attained the fame that had previously been exclusively reserved for accomplished artists, scientists, athletes, war heroes, and politicians. Thus, they became, in a sense, the authors or geniuses of manual labor, inadvertently answering the question from the Chinese Cultural Revolution saying: Is it necessary for a steel worker to put his name on a steel ingot that he produces in the course of his duty, Alford, supra n. 12, at 56'Marx ... quite firmly believed that this emancipation [of the proletariat] could not be achieved by the proletarians themselves alone, as the proletariat lacked, due to the very circumstances which had made it into an abject proletariat in the first place, the intellectual ability to develop its self-awareness as a class' (Avineri, supra n. 5, at 274)Trotsky, supra n. 5, at 217. In fact, as we will show further on, this was equally true in the time of the French Revolution, where the 'greatest minds' overwhelmed with numerous administrative duties lacked energy to participate actively in the creation of culture'_ this cleavage can even develop into a certain opposition and hostility between the two parts, which, however, in the case of a practical collision, in which the class itself is endangered, automatically comes to nothing, in which case there also vanishes the semblance that the ruling class ideas were not the ideas of the ruling class and had a power distinct from the power of this class' (from The German Ideology, The Marx-Engels Reader, supra n. 7, at 137)Spaić, supra n. 18, at 14-15The paradigm for this originated from a most reputable source: 'Publishing and distributing centres, bookshops and reading-rooms, libraries and similar establishments - must all be under party control. The organised socialist proletariat must keep an eye on all this work, supervise it in its entirety, and, from beginning to end, without any exception...'

In his account of the political hold over Soviet literature of the mid-1940s to late 1950, Harold Swayze enumerates material benefits, such as Litfund, a Writers' Union welfare organization, which lay at the disposal of the politically correct authors, but were denied to authors too far from either the ideological or, often, geographical center.

abstract={Authorship entails the constrained selection or generation of media and the organization and layout of that media in a larger structure. But authorship is more than just selection and organization; it is a complex construct incorporating concepts of originality, authority, intertextuality, and attribution. In this paper we explore these concepts and ask how they are changing in light of modes of collaborative authorship in remix culture. We present a qualitative case study of an online video remixing site, illustrating how the constraints of that environment are impacting authorial constructs. We discuss users' self-conceptions as authors, and how values related to authorship are reflected to users through the interface and design of the site's tools. We also present some implications for the design of online communities for collaborative media creation and remixing. Copyright 2007 ACM.},

abstract={In a few years, Wilcipedia has become one of the information systems with more public (both producers and consumers) of the Internet. Its system and information architecture is relatively simple, but has proven to be capable of supporting the largest and more diverse community of collaborative authorship worldwide. In this paper, we analyze in detail this community, and the contents it is producing. Using a quantitative methodology based on the analysis of the public Wikipedia databases, we describe the main characteristics of the 10 largest language editions, and the authors that work in them. The methodology (which is almost completely automated) is generic enough to be used on the rest of the editions, providing a convenient framework to develop a complete quantitative analysis of the Wikipedia. Among other parameters, we study the evolution of the number of contributions and articles, their size, and the differences in contributions by different authors, inferring some relationships between contribution patterns and content. These relationships reflect (and in part, explain) the evolution of the different language editions so far, as well as their future trends.},

abstract={Recent developments in online collaborative technologies such as Wikipedia (www.wikipedia.org) have demonstrated the potential usefulness of an online reference resource produced as the collective effort of many users. Although this type of resource has enjoyed success in the public arena, however, its value remains unproved in the academic community. RadiologyWiki (www.RadiologyWiki.org) was created to apply the technology and methods of collaborative authorship to create a dynamic online radiology educational resource. The World Wide Web site capitalizes on the core technology of Wikipedia, allowing individuals with little technical experience to easily create, categorize, and search for articles by using a standard Web browser. RadiologyWiki shows promise for applications in the field of radiology, although issues pertaining to copyright, peer review, and academic motivation must be overcome if it is to make a meaningful contribution in this context. Nevertheless, it is hoped that RadiologyWiki will develop into a free, simple, and rapid collaborative authorship tool for communication and education in radiology. ©RSNA, 2007.},

abstract={This article reports on a self-study that focuses on encouraging a group of undergraduate students to be active learners by promoting their critical engagement with what they are learning. The descriptions and explanations in the self-study give account of the contradictions and challenges encountered in my attempts to reconcile between students' perceptions of my 'authority' as the lecturer, constraints inherent in curriculum design and my commitment to dialogical education. My pursuit of a democratic, critically engaged collaborative scholarship led me to reconceptualise my teaching and learning interactions with my students through the lens of a dynamic 'living educational theory', thereby negotiating contradictions while improving my educational practice. The article concludes that, albeit somewhat attenuated, what Whitehead calls 'living contradictions' still persist and will require a re-examination of 'macro' objectives of the whole programme and further collaborative action, involving students and colleagues in the pursuit of dialogical education.},

abstract={Involvement and critique from educators in dialogue with researchers is a vital element for achieving clarity about what research will benefit educational policy and practice. With that aim, the American Association for Higher Education (AAHE) Research Forum has been regularly convened at AAHE's annual conference to create a research agenda around the conference theme since 1985. This year, within a conference addressing 'Good Work in Challenging Times' the Forum involved individuals committed to collaborative scholarship on good work in teaching and learning-centered contexts. Through two conference sessions, educational practitioners engaged in lively and intellectually challenging small-group discussions about the scholarship of 'good work.' In this way, session participants were involved in creating the research agenda given in this article. Copyright © 2003, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.},

It describes the problems associated with research on these communities in the absence of measurable monetary transactions, and suggests possible alternatives. A class of techniques using software source code as factual documentation of economic activity is described and a methodology for the extraction, interpretation and analysis of empirical data from software source code is detailed, with the outline of algorithms for identifying collaborative authorship and determining the identity of coherent economic actors in developer communities. Finally, conclusions are drawn from the application of these techniques to a base of software.},

abstract={The present information explosion on the World Wide Web poses a problem for the general public and the members of an academic discipline alike, of how to find the most authoritative, comprehensive, and up-to-date information about an important topic. At the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP), we have since 1995 been developing and implementing the concept of a dynamic reference work (DRW) to provide a solution to these problems, while maintaining free access for readers. A DRW is much more than a web-based encyclopedia, and its scope far exceeds that of an electronic journal or preprint exchange. In this article we document the progress of the SEP toward full implementation of the DRW concept. We discuss the fiscal challenges posed by our desire to maintain free or low-cost access to the contents of the SEP, and we consider technological challenges posed by the desire to stay abreast of technological developments in document markup while making it easy for authors and subject editors to write and maintain entries representing the very best scholarship. © Colin Allen, Uri Nodelman, and Edward N.

abstract={Today, global economic competitiveness and public policy responsiveness are primary driving forces for continuous technological development and innovation in engineering and technology professional practice. A new model of purposeful, systematic technology innovation has evolved and regional industries and government must continuously develop their innovative capacity (intellectual property) to stay competitive and sustain economic growth. Graduate education must reflect this change, understand the new relationships between customer needs, directed scientific research, and engineering/technology leadership. For the U.S. to sustain global competitiveness, traditional graduate studies must undergo educational reform. The three broad mandates for this collaborative effort are: To create new models of needs-driven, professionally oriented graduate education through the master and doctoral levels that better support engineering and technology innovation. To involve industry and government as key partners in this advancement for both national and regional economic development. To provide new mechanisms for sustained collaboration among the participating universities, by using a new internet-based communication that enables collaborative scholarship without regard to geographical location. The strengths of the alliance are the critical mass effect for educational change that results through multi-university collaboration, and the rapidity for the exchange and sharing of new ideas, experiences, and scholarship through the use of electronically mediated communication, which is required to make this transformation a collective reality.},

abstract={Academic librarians, particularly college librarians, may increase their contributions to the professional literature through collaborative authorship. For example, university librarians, who published 69 percent of the articles in College & Research Libraries and the Journal of Academic Librarianship between 1986 and 1996, contributed almost 90 percent of the coauthored research in those core journals. This study examines the increase in collaboration in the literature of academic librarianship and in other disciplines, explores the relationship between collaboration and article quality as well as author productivity, compares collaborative patterns of college and university librarians, and considers factors that lead to successful collaboration.},

abstract={Many universities are experimenting with interprofessional programs to better prepare professionals to tackle the complex problems faced by children and families. Universities face three major challenges: overcoming the compartmentalization of professional schools, which is then reflected in fragmentation of service delivery; learning to function as effective partners with communities; and reconceptualizing the nature of professional expertise to include collaborative scholarship and practice. The authors found that collaborative work can offer scholars substantial intellectual challenges, learning opportunities, and a new kind of access to the community, which can receive increased professional assistance. Interprofessional education is likely to promote alternative conceptions of teaching, scholarship, program design, and community service. However, it is personally and intellectually demanding, costly in time and other resources, and institutionally fragile. The open question is how many university faculty and administrators will take on the challenges of responding to new needs and demands for training human service professionals.},

abstract={Across cultures, narrative emerges early in communicative development and is a fundamental means of making sense of experience. Narrative and self are inseparable in that narrative is simultaneously born out of experience and gives shape to experience. Narrative activity provides tellers with an opportunity to impose order on otherwise disconnected events, and to create continuity between past, present, and imagined worlds. Narrative also interfaces self and society, constituting a crucial resource for socializing emotions, attitudes, and identities, developing interpersonal relationships, and constituting membership in a community. Through various genres and modes; through discourse, grammar, lexicon, and prosody; and through the dynamics of collaborative authorship, narratives bring multiple, partial selves to life.},

abstract={This paper reports on a long-term effort to investigate computer-aided collaborative authorship. The work has developed from a communications (as opposed to word-processing) perspective, exploring enhancements to standard message and conferencing systems that make them more amenable to the special needs of joint authorship. We begin by discussing the special nature of the joint authoring task and mention other research into computer support for this activity. Next we report on several informal experiments we have conducted, including the writing of this paper. The focus of the paper is an analysis of the problems we have encountered in using different versions of our joint-authoring software and new mechanisms we have developed to deal with them.},
